    title: "What is Babylon?",
    content: `<p>Babylon is a suite of security-sharing protocols that bring Bitcoin\’s unparalleled security to the decentralized world. The latest protocol, Bitcoin Staking, enables Bitcoin holders to stake their Bitcoin to provide crypto-economic security to PoS (proof-of-stake) systems in a trustless and self-custodial way.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "How does Bitcoin Staking Work?",
    content: `<p>${coinName} holders lock their ${coinName} using the trustless and self-custodial Bitcoin Staking script for a predetermined time (timelock) in exchange for voting power in an underlying PoS protocol. In return, Bitcoin holders will earn PoS staking rewards.</p><br />
      <p>Finality providers perform the voting. A ${coinName} staker can create a finality provider by itself and self-delegate or delegate its voting power to a third-party finality provider.</p><br />
      <p>If a finality provider attacks the PoS system, the ${coinName}s behind the voting powers delegated to it will be subject to protocol slashing. This deters ${coinName} stakers and finality providers from attacking the PoS system.</p>
      `,
  },
  {
    title: "What is the goal of this testnet?",
    content: `<p>The goal of this testnet is to ensure the security of the staked Bitcoins by testing the user's interaction with the ${coinName} network. This will be a lock-only network without any PoS chain operating, meaning that the only participants of this testnet will be finality providers and ${coinName} stakers.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "What does this staking dApp allow me to do?",
    content: `<p>The staking dApp allows ${coinName} holders to stake their ${coinName} and delegate their voting power to a finality provider they select. Stakers can view their past staking history and on-demand unlock their stake for early withdrawal.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: `Does my ${coinName} leave my wallet once staked?`,
    content: `<p>Yes, it leaves your wallet. Your wallet will not show it as your available balance because it is locked. However, it is not sent to any third party. It is locked in a self-custodial contract you control. This means that any subsequent movement of the ${coinName} will need your approval, and you are the only one who can unbond the stake and withdraw.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: `Is my ${coinName} Safe? Could I get slashed?`,
    content: `<p>In this testnet, you are not required to sign any PoS slashing-related authorizations. Thus, in theory, the ${coinName} in your self-custodial contract cannot be slashed due to the absence of your authorization.</p><br />

    <p>However, there are still risks associated with your ${coinName}:</p><br />
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        1. Code security<br />
        There is an inherent risk that the code developed for Bitcoin staking has vulnerabilities or bugs. The Babylon team has open-sourced the code, and it is under security audits.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        2. System reliability<br />
        The Bitcoin staking system may be slow, unavailable, or compromised, which may cause the staking service to be unavailable or compromised, potentially leading to ${coinName} not being unbindable or not withdrawable.
      </li>
    </ol>

    title: "How long will it take for my stake to become active?",
    content: `<p>A stake’s status demonstrates the current stage of the staking process. All stake starts in a Pending state which denotes that the ${coinName} Staking transaction does not yet have sufficient ${coinName} block confirmations. As soon as it receives 10 ${coinName} block confirmations, the status transitions to <i>Overflow</i> or <i>Active</i>. </p><br />
    
    <p>In an amount-based cap, A stake is <i>Overflow</i> if the system has already accumulated the maximum amount of ${coinName} it can accept.</p><br />
    <p>In a time-based cap, where there is a starting block height and ending block height, a stake is <i>overflow</i> if it is included in a ${coinName} block that is newer than the ending block.</p><br /> 
    <p>Otherwise, the stake is <i>Active</i>.</p><br /> 
    <p><i>Overflow</i> stake should be on-demand unbonded and withdrawn.</p>`,

    title: "Do I get rewards for staking?",
    content: `<p>No. This is a locking-only testnet without a PoS chain. There is no PoS staking reward nor incentives for participation.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "Are there any other ways to stake?",
    content: `<p>Hands-on stakers can operate the <a href="https://github.com/babylonchain/btc-staker/blob/dev/docs/create-phase1-staking.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary"><u>btc-staker CLI program</u></a> that allows for the creation of ${coinName} staking transactions from the CLI.</p>
